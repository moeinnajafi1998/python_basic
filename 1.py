# What is Python?
# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. 
# It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, 
# and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
